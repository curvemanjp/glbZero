# glbZero
Here we will describe that python program to get global zero points of a contineous function.

## Where does a function have zero value?
 We want to know all zero points if possible.

 Let us consider real valued contineous functions on a bounded interval

 and we assume that the function dealt with here has  finite number of zero points.
 
 Continuous functions are not always differentiable, so we cannot enjoy the benefits of differentiation.
